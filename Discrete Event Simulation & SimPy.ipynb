    "    #make a decision branch with an if statement. For simulation, use a uniform distribution for a probability (between 0 and 1) and this can randomly generate a probabltility of going down a route. Then compare to your defining percentages (0.2 and 0.8 in the example) and that will choose the route to which the element proceeds.\n",
    "    #Referring to a variable not inside a function, need to use the global keyword to pull variables outside in the global environment. Not the best approach - shows need for OOP.\n",
    "    #If we want multuple generators, then define generators at top. Don't forget to start multiple processes if you have them!\n",
    "    #If you want to get the results, since these are stochastic (random) models, then we need to run multiple times. To do so, put in a for loop and set the number of runs. Then you can save out the results into a global object or save to a file (.csv) before the next run starts on a new line. You can then import the results and do some statistics on this to get a better idea (high power) of real world results.\n",
    "    #We are currently assuming our entities are empty when we first start the simulation. We can do this in some instances (GP with no patients at opening and no patients at closing). If modelling 24 hour systems, we need to have entitites in there to start. We can use a warm up period to get entitites in the system. Can approach warm up period in different ways depending on system being modeled. Set teh warm up period then do if statement before results are collected on each activity. \n",
